## A Network-Enhanced Computational Framework for Uncovering Novel Disease Mechanisms in Cardiovascular Disease

**Abstract**

Unraveling the complex web of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) requires a deep, systems-level understanding of the biological pathways that drive them. While many computational tools exist, they often struggle to connect disparate biological data, leaving many disease mechanisms hidden. Here, we introduce CardioXNet, a computational framework designed to systematically uncover and prioritize these hidden pathways. CardioXNet weaves together protein-protein interaction networks, knowledge from multiple pathway databases (GO, KEGG, Reactome, WikiPathways), and tissue-specific expression data from GTEx, all viewed through a cardiac-specific lens of over 700 cardiovascular terms. Our 12-stage pipeline is engineered for discovery, featuring network-based exploration of secondary pathways, rigorous multi-dimensional validation with permutation testing (1000x), and evidence scoring from the vast body of literature in PubMed. In a benchmark analysis with five key cardiac development genes (GATA4, NKX2-5, TBX5, HAND2, ISL1), CardioXNet unearthed 47 statistically significant pathways, 15 of which were not found in the initial analysis, highlighting its power for novel discovery. Moreover, CardioXNet pinpoints promising therapeutic targets by integrating network topology with a curated database of over 150 cardiac disease genes from ClinVar and OMIM, which elevated the ranking of a well-known cardiac transcription factor, GATA4, by more than 70%. By painting a richer, more comprehensive picture of the cardiac disease landscape, CardioXNet empowers cardiovascular researchers to discover previously unknown disease mechanisms and identify high-priority therapeutic targets with greater confidence.
