### **Main Section: A Multi-Layered Data Ecosystem**

**Key Message:** CardioXNet achieves its discovery power by integrating a diverse ecosystem of biological data, providing a comprehensive, multi-dimensional view that spans from molecular interactions to clinical relevance.

**Visual:** A central CardioXNet logo with data streams flowing in from logos of the various databases (STRING, GO, KEGG, Reactome, WikiPathways, GTEx, PubMed, ClinVar, OMIM).

### **Data Integration Table**

| Data Layer | Database(s) | Coverage & Scale | Purpose in CardioXNet |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Protein-Protein Interactions** | STRING PPI (v12.0) | 24.6M proteins, 6.3B interactions | Builds the foundational network for pathway expansion and topological analysis. |
| **Pathway & Functional Enrichment** | g:Profiler (GO:BP, KEGG, Reactome, WikiPathways) | 10,000+ pathways | Identifies primary biological processes and molecular functions. |
| **Tissue-Specific Expression** | GTEx (v8) | 54 tissues, 948 donors | Validates the cardiac specificity of identified pathways and genes. |
| **Scientific Literature** | PubMed | 36M+ biomedical articles | Provides evidence-based scoring and literature validation for all discoveries. |
| **Cardiac Disease Genes** | Curated Database (ClinVar, OMIM) | 150+ high-confidence cardiac genes | Enables quantitative scoring of cardiac relevance for therapeutic targets. |
| **Cardiovascular Semantics** | Proprietary Lexicon | 700+ curated terms | Ensures all identified pathways are highly relevant to cardiovascular diseases. |

### **Bottom Banner: Key Takeaways**

**1. Breadth of Coverage:** By integrating four major pathway databases, CardioXNet provides one of the most comprehensive views of the biological landscape available.

**2. Depth of Validation:** Multi-layer validation (tissue expression, literature, clinical relevance) ensures that all discoveries are not just statistically significant, but also biologically meaningful.

**3. Cardiac Specificity:** The integration of a curated cardiac disease gene database and a proprietary semantic lexicon makes CardioXNet uniquely powerful for cardiovascular research.
